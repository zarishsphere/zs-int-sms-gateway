## Executive Summary

**SMS gateway adapters — Twilio, Africa's Talking, local operators.**

This document defines the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** scope for `zs-int-sms-gateway` within the ZarishSphere sovereign digital health platform. It covers what must be built first, acceptance criteria, user stories, and the complete repository file structure.


### Platform Non-Negotiables (apply to every repository)

| Constraint | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Zero Cost** | All tooling, hosting, and services must use genuinely free tiers |
| **Open Source** | Apache 2.0 license; all code public |
| **FHIR R5 Native** | All clinical data modelled as FHIR R5 resources |
| **Offline-First** | Must function without network connectivity |
| **No-Coder Friendly** | GUI-first, template-driven, automatable |
| **Documentation as Code** | All decisions in GitHub via RFC/ADR |
| **Multi-tenant** | tenant_id scoping on all data operations |
| **HIPAA/GDPR** | AuditEvent on all PHI access; field-level encryption |

---

## Problem Statement

Appointment reminders, outbreak alerts, and health education messages must reach patients via SMS, the most accessible channel in target countries.

## MVP Goals

1. Implement the primary data flow direction (Outbound (FHIR CommunicationRequest → SMS))
2. Field-level mapping between SMS-GATEWAY and FHIR R5 documented and implemented
3. Error handling with dead-letter queue and retry
4. Integration test with real (mock) SMS-GATEWAY endpoint

## MVP Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
|----|------------|---------------------|---------|
| M-01 | Primary direction (Outbound (FHIR CommunicationRequest → SMS)) working | Data flows; FHIR resources created/updated | P0 |
| M-02 | Field mapping documented in MAPPING.md | All mapped fields listed with types | P0 |
| M-03 | Retry with exponential backoff | Failed requests retry up to 5 times | P0 |
| M-04 | Dead-letter queue via NATS | Failed messages visible in NATS DLQ | P1 |
| M-05 | FHIR AuditEvent for each exchange | AuditEvent appears in audit log | P1 |

## Protocol Support

- Twilio REST API
- Africa's Talking SMS API
- Local operator HTTP APIs

## Mapping Note

FHIR CommunicationRequest → adapter → provider-specific SMS API call
